# Dynamic programming
- Recursion without repetition
- Each sub problem must be evaluated only once
- Naive recursion approach takes exponential time due to repetition 
# Top down with memoisation
- This is depth first search implementation of recursion
- Cache repetitive work
# Bottom up
- Is based on dependency graph
- Convert recursion into dependency graph
- It is directed acyclic graph
- You can sort DAG using topological sort
- One way to avoid repetition is to calculate as per topological sort order
- This is solving based on increasing sub problem
- Write iterative code
